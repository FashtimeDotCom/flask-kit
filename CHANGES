Flask-Kit Changelog
===================

Here you can see the Flask-Kit evolution.


Version 0.2.2
-------------
- The `manage.py` implementation
- Management command `shell`. The :class:`Shell` from the Flask-Script package
  doesn't work with iPython >= 0.12, so there is custom class to work around that
- Blueprint-by-Templates system implementation
- New helper :class:`BlueprintPackageFactory`
- Management command `createblueprint` to quickly build new blueprint packages


Version 0.2.1
-------------
- The :attr:`APP_MODULE` in settings.py has been renamed to `APP_PACKAGE`
- The :mod:`app` has been renamed to `application`
- More clean `AppFactory` class


Version 0.2
-----------
First big refactoring. Project structure has been frozen.


Version 0.1.1
-------------
Kit core, project rearranging and some example files


Version 0.1
-----------
First release, first commit, rather vague project structure
